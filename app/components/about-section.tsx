        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>
          I&apos;ve always been driven by a need to understand how things work
          beneath the surface. I started learning Python to explore logic and
          automation, but that quickly evolved into a deeper curiosity about how
          people interact with software. That led me to web development, where I
          learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and began building fullstack
          applications using BaaS platforms. Eventually, I wanted more control
          over how things worked behind the scenes, so I dove into backend
          development, designing systems, managing data, and building more
          complex solutions.

          As I grew, I read widely on software engineering principles, took part
          in hackathons, and worked on projects that pushed me to solve
          real-world problems. When the web wasn&apos;t enough, I explored
          mobile development to access native capabilities. I became deeply
          interested in cross-platform performance, native APIs, and even
          building native modules to push the limits of what I could create.
          Now, I focus on building scalable, high-performance applications
          across web and mobile, always aiming for clean architecture, intuitive
          user experience, and long-term maintainability.
