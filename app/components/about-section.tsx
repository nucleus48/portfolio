        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>
          I&apos;ve always been driven by a need to understand how software
          works beneath the surface. My journey began with Python, where I
          explored logic, automation, and problem solving fundamentals. That
          curiosity naturally expanded into how people interact with systems,
          leading me into web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and
          eventually into building full-stack applications using BaaS platforms.
        </p>

        <p>
          As my projects grew in complexity, abstraction was no longer enough. I
          wanted deeper control over system behavior, data flow, and
          performance, which pushed me into backend development. I began
          designing APIs, managing databases, and building systems where
          reliability, scalability, and correctness mattered as much as
          functionality.
        </p>

        <p>
          Along the way, I strengthened my engineering foundation by studying
          software design principles, participating in hackathons, and working
          on real world products that demanded ownership beyond writing code.
          When the web became limiting, I expanded into mobile development to
          access native capabilities and deliver richer user experiences. This
          sparked a strong interest in cross-platform performance, native APIs,
          and building custom native modules to push platform boundaries.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, I focus on building scalable, high performance applications
          across web and mobile. I approach engineering with a product mindset
          prioritizing clean architecture, intuitive user experience, and
          systems that remain maintainable long after they reach production.
